Welcome to whoever stumbles upon this blog of mine. I'm Josh and I'm... well you can read about that
[here](/about).

The purpose of this blog is to help myself and other software engineers overcome the complexities we
all deal with on a daily basis.

The frustrating reality we all face especially in the world of software engineering is that unless
you write a line of code, a function, a configuration many times, it probably won't stick unless you
do it multiple times. So we _bookmark that StackOverflow answer_ or we _google that question again_.
While I'm all for those as reminders of how we got something to work, I'm just choosing to write my
findings here.

I try to spread information to my colleagues on a daily basis with findings of failures and
successes so why not put it in a "public notebook" of some sorts?

If you read up to here, I appreciate it. And if you are a software engineer yourself, I hope that
any of my posts can help you as well.
